This is a GUI toolkit made with Zig and SDL2.

I'm hoping to make this as a textbook example usage of Zig to build a large system

**Contributions Welcome!**

Please feel free to make any changes that take full advantage of Zig. I'm sure there are many places.


### Running
Make sure you have SDL2 and SDL2_ttf installed as a system library. The project is not pulling them as dependant modules yet, so they must be present ahead of time.
This has only been tested on linux.

```cd``` into the top level directory and then ```zig build run``` to take it for a spin!
